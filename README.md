# Simplified-Dart-Classes-and-Object
Dart classes are the blueprint of the object, or it can be called object constructors. A class can contain fields, functions, constructors, etc. It is a wrapper that binds/encapsulates the data and functions together; that can be accessed by creating an object. A class can refer to as user-define data type which defines characteristics by its all objects.

We can assume a class as a sketch (prototype) or a car. It contains all the details about model name, year, features, price, etc. Based on these properties of the car, we can build the car. Here the car is an object. There can be many cars so we can create many objects of cars to access all the properties.

Defining a Class in Dart

Dart provides class keyword followed by a class name is used to define a class; all fields and functions are enclosed by the pair of curly braces ({}). The syntax is given below.

class ClassName {  
   <fields>  
   <getters/setters>  
  <constructor>  
 <functions>  
}
